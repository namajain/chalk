<div align="justify">
I don't think you will ever read it, I doubt I would ever tell you these thoughts, but these are the honest-to-heart feelings that I hold for you.
<br />

<br />
You are my angel, my savior and I can't imagine my life if you were not in it.
<br />

<br />
Sure we have lots of fights, we say some words that we shouldn't have, but trust me after each fight all I want is to hug you so hard, you'll forget every bad memory you have.
<br />

<br />
You say I don't love you, that I never tell you my feelings or open up to you, please know that I am bad with words, always was, but words can't even begin to describe my love for you, I love you more than anything else in the world, even more than my life.
<br />

<br />
We don't stay together as much as we used to, and our time together shrinks every passing year but not a day goes by when I don't think of you. You are there with me, in my heart, every moment.
<br />

<br />
I am writing this to make sure that my feelings towards you, remain unchanged, forever, no matter how far apart we are. You are the ray of sunshine which took away all the darkness in my life.
<br />
