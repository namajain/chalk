<div align="justify">
It was the night before,<br />When all through the world,<br />No words, no dreams<br />Then one day,<br />A writer by a fire<br />Imagined all of Gaia<br />Took a journey into a child-man's heart...<br /><br />A painter on the shore<br />Imagined all the world<br />Within a snowflake on his palm<br />Unframed by poetry<br />A canvas of awe<br />Planet Earth falling back into the stars<br /><br />I am the voice of Never, Never Land<br />The innocence, the dreams of every man<br />I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,<br />A soaring kite against the blue, blue sky,<br />Every chimney, every moonlit sight<br />I am the story that will read you real,<br />Every memory that you hold dear
