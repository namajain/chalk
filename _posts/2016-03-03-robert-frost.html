<b>Stopping by Woods ~</b>
<br />

<br />
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
<br />
But I have promises to keep,
<br />
And miles to go before I sleep,
<br />
And miles to go before I sleep.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<b>&nbsp;The Road Not Taken ~</b>
<br />

<br />
I shall be telling this with a sigh
<br />
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
<br />
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
<br />
I took the one less traveled by,
<br />
And that has made all the difference.&nbsp;
