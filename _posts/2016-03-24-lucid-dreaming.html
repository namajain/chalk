A few months ago, while browsing the net, I stumbled across a post that piqued my interest. It was a fairly long post that proceeded to describe the experiences of the author's foray into the world of Lucid Dreaming.
<br />

<br />
What is Lucid Dreaming ? One might ask.
<br />
Well, Lucid dreaming is simply being aware that you are dreaming. With enough  experience, you can control your dreams â€” anything from  flying to creating people and places, and even changing into animals.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I was so excited at this prospect, that I spent the whole day scouring the web for any and all the information that I could get on the topic.
<br />
Fast-Forward a few months, and now I can remember most of the important details of my dream and control, to a certain extent, the outcome of my dreams.
<br />

<br />
While my skill in lucid dreaming is not as great as that of the more experienced users, it has helped me a great deal nonetheless. Just to give you an example, I am currently writing a fiction novel as a hobby project, with lucid dreaming's help I can enter the realm of my novel and feel the world through my protagonists eyes. I can replay what I have written and get inspiration for the story too.
<br />
There are also times when I enter into a dream just to tell off some of my sadistic professors.
<br />
I know I shouldn't but it feels so good :p
<br />

<br />
