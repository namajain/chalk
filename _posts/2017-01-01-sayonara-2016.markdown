What an year it was! I did many things I never imagined doing - 
* Went to gym for 6 months straight
* Became more punctual and hardworking
* Made new friends be it on a bus ride or flight or taxi
* Lost a couple of friends
* Improved photography skills
* woke at 6 am most part of the year
* Bathed daily after waking at the count of 3 under freezing cold water
* Did public speaking
* Suffered heartbreak
* Tried to propose to a TA, and hilariously failed
* Visited USA and Andaman Islands
* Did scuba diving
* Cancelled flights after being stranded in a Cyclone
* Took pic of Tejshree's home
* Made friends with a 15 yo badass poet
* Wrote poems myself
* Devoured self-dev books
* Brought a tab
* Broke it
* Got tipsy
* Tried my hands at pickup
* Talked to random strangers
* Dated a vampire
* Attended graphics lecture
* Tortured others with singing
* Got scouted by a roadside pamphlate distributor cum religious guru
* Who later went to CalTech :o 
* Went to his hostel, ate lunch and discussed meaning of life for 5 hours straight
* Saw a Microsoft Code Fun Do through the end
* Caught chickenpox
* Did the bramhaputra beach night shoot
* Then morning shoot
* Opened demat account
* Swiped off cognac 

I learned a few things too -
* Attachment is bad, be it with people, games or other things
* Integrity, hard work and persistence are more valuable than talent
* You'll never feel like it, there will always, so just wake up and get shit done 

2016 was an awesome year, did many things never thought I could do, met many interesting people in the unlikeliest of places, got to learn many new things about the world and myself, and at the end of it all, I can proudly say, 2016 was not "just another year"
I feel 2017 is gonna be even better and hope the same for everyone, Happy New Year
