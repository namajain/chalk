<h3><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot;, &quot;arial&quot;, &quot;helvetica&quot;, sans-serif;"><b>Learn to love yourself, because only then will you be able to love the world </b></span></h3>

While Self-Love is the most important trait a person can have, I think many people are misinformed as to what it exactly is. Let me begin by defining what Self-Love is and what it is not.
<br />

Self-Love is the ability to love yourself no matter how grim the circumstances are, to make mistakes and not berate yourself for making them.
<br />

Self-Love also entails a little bit of selfishness, to say no when required, to not sacrifice your own happiness for the sake of pleasing others, to not act like a disposable napkin for them to use and throw. You shouldn't go out of your way to help everyone, instead it should be reserved only for those who value it and understand its worth.
<br />

Lastly, Self-Love requires courage, to go and take some difficult decisions in order to preserve your happiness and peace of mind. A perfect example would be for someone to end a toxic relationship even if it is difficult to do so.
<br />

But some people twist it to their own comfort. An obese guy not working out because he thinks he should love himself the way he is? No, that's not Self-Love, that's just an excuse to mask his own laziness.
<br />


<br />

Now that I have explained what Self-Love is, the next question arises, why Self-Love?
<br />

It almost seems silly to ask, after-all if you don't love yourself then who else will?
<br />

Self-Love is the segue to important qualities like peace, confidence, motivation, charm etc. Once you love yourself, you won't allow yourself to do degrading or unjust acts, nor would you be troubled by petty emotions like jealousy. 
<br />

Most importantly you will learn to love the world and to value the things around you.
<br />

You will be able to shift your frame of reference from outside to inside, instead of comparing yourself with other people and deferring to their opinions you will be able to think for yourself and the only comparison you'll ever make, is with the person you were the day before.
<br />

I know it seems like a magic pill, one that is the solution to all of the world's problems. Call me a dreamer, but I firmly believe there would be world peace if everybody loved themselves.
<br />


<br />

Now, the last question, how do you obtain Self-Love?
<br />

Well, one way is by receiving unconditional love, like the one people get from their parents. Most people naturally develop it this way. Other possible sources could be pets or even a loving partner.
<br />
<div align="center">
But what if you had a rough childhood? 
<br />

Don't have pets or feel that you are destined to be forever alone?
<br />
</div>

Fear not my friend, there is still hope left for you - 
<br />

Have you ever noticed that the more you work on something, the more time you spend on it, the more you value it? Well, it turns out that it works on people too, the more you invest your time in someone the more you will love him/her. 
<br />

What if that someone is you? It's simple, if you invest your time in developing yourself, if you enrich your mind by reading books, your body by exercising, your personality by cultivating hobbies, and your experiences by trying out different thing and pushing your boundaries, somewhere along the way, you will fall in love with yourself :)
