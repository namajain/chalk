We have a lab in which none of us take seriously, we get codes, explain haphazardly and get marks.<br />

Still, I used to tweak around and understand the working behind every assignment, every code.<br />
On result day, I got low marks in few assignments, naturally, I went to the TA. With a smug smile he gave me another problem and promised to give me full marks for every assignment if I was able to do it.<br />

I think he was hoping that since everybody copies, I won't be able to do it. Turns out he was wrong, I walked away with a perfect score on the excel and a smile on my face :)<br />
<br />
One of our professors is super boring. It's to the point that if he even glances at you once, you will fall asleep. Obviously, no one ever attends his lectures, no one - except for one student.<br />
One fine day, I was feeling a little brave and decided to give his lectures another try. I was a little late for the class and when I entered I was assailed by an indescribable emotion.
There were two people in the room. The prof and the student. Both had their attention focused on the board. The prof was busy writing theorems and proofs and the student, faithfully replicating them in the notebook. No words were spoken, nothing could be heard except for torturous sound of chalk scratching on the board.<br />
I wondered - just how many solitary mornings has this same depressing situation been played out ? The lonely prof and the dedicated student.
I made a decision then, that no matter how difficult it might be, I'll attend every single lecture of the course and I'm really proud that I stuck to it till the very end.<br />
