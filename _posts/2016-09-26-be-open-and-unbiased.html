<span data-offset-key="25gul-0-0"><span data-text="true">I went to collect a courier today. There were two people there. The girl asked for my name to retrieve the courier and the guy there, misheard Naman Jain as Ramanujan.<br /> We both started laughing. We talked for a bit and it occurred to me that I should ask him if he saw The Man Who Knew Infinity ( A movie based on the life of Ramanujan ). <br />But the guy looked like a village bumpkin who wouldn't know much about the topic or Hollywood movies for that matter. Fortunately I realized my mistake ( thanks to the words of a certain awesome person ) , I was letting his appearance cloud my judgement.&nbsp; <br />I made amends immediately,</span></span><span data-offset-key="25gul-0-0"><span data-text="true"> as it turned out, not only had he watched the movie but he also knew much about Ramanujan. We had a nice long conversation on related topics, I was also reminded of two important qualities I want to posses, being open and being unbiased :)</span></span>
