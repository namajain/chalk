<span class="_5yl5">Its very easy to question what they do. They just capture the world in front of them. One can easily dismiss their work saying it was the place that was beautiful, not your art. <br />They don't see the effort put behind a photo.<br />The countless failed attempts in order to get that perfect click. <br />The nights passed battling their sleep in order to get the lighting that makes the photo magical.<br />The hours passed sweating in the sun, waiting for the subjects to be in just the right position.<br />Their creativity in trying to find the perspective that makes an otherwise dull and bleak photo come to life. <br />Yes, nature photos are always good , but it's the hard work of the photographer that makes a good photo turn exquisite .</span>
