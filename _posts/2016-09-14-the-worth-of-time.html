<div align="justify">
True worth of time is only realized when you are doing something important and time passes away like a torrent. It's only at this time you know exactly how little time you have to pursue your interests and the weight of all the days you wasted indulging in leisure, starts to grow heavy on your heart. <br />But the sad thing is, this revelation lasts only a day, as the weight pressing you down slowly starts to lift, you find yourself going back to burning daylight as usual.
