<div align="justify">
<div style="padding-left: 1em; text-align: center; text-indent: -1em;">Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” 
<br />
I took the one less traveled by,
<br />
And that has made all the difference.</div>


<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br />

</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The prospect of exploring the uncharted, doing what no one has ever done, seems really enticing to hear but if given the opportunity to risk everything and do what our heart tells us to, how many would actually take it ?
<br />

Lately I've been thinking, most of our actions are guided by a desire to avoid pain, not because of the desire to achieve something. We study to avoid the pain of getting low grades, not because we want to learn. We take a job to avoid the pain of not having any money, not because we love the work we do.
<br />

And the worst part is, we are not even aware</span> of this little quirk of ours. This desire to avoid pain is so dominant that sometimes we even turn a blind eye to the fact that taking some pain now would help reduce a lot of pain in the future.

<br />

</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">We should strive to be aware of our actions and the reasons behind them and consciously make an effort not to be guided by fear or pain because only then would we truly be free to take the road not taken </div><div style="text-align: left;">
