<div style="text-align: center;">Have you ever thought of doing something creative but then didn't do it because of lack of time, money or resources ?<br />
</div><div style="text-align: center;">Did you push all the ideas to the back of your mind, in a big heap labelled <br />
"Waiting for the Perfect Moment" ?<br />
<br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Chances are that those ideas are still lying there, in the heap of half forgotten ideas, that only continues to grow bigger in time, like the single cup of coffee placed on an Indian road that, over the time, has turned into a filthy, foul smelling heap of garbage. Even thinking about it evokes in you the feelings of guilt, regret and helplessness but just like that heap of garbage you choose to turn a blind eye towards your heap of creativity that is slowly rotting away and polluting the environment of your mind.<br />
<br />
You feel helpless, bound by your habits, laziness and aversion to even the slightest of discomfort.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It's tough to fight if the enemy is your own self. After an exhausting battle with your inner demons, you have finally gathered enough motivation to venture out of your comfort zone. You've hardly taken a step and you find yourself facing the frightening and seemingly invincible monsters that are the fear of ridicule, of failure and uncertainty.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
At this point, you have to make a decision, you are given two choices.<br />
One is to continue waiting for that elusive "Perfect Moment" where there is no uncertainty, no chance of failure or ridicule. Unless, by some miracle, that mythical moment finally appears, your creativity will wither away until all you are capable of is following the same old routine in the confines of your apparent comfort.</div><div style="text-align: left;">Or you can simply put on your headphones, play an epic score, show the finger to the monsters and follow your cleaning ... err ... calling just like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf1VA5jqmRo" target="_blank">these people</a><br />
<br />
