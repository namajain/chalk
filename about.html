  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I am a Software Engineer at Visa, developing the administrative infrastructure of VisaVue Marketplace.<br/>
    As a firm proponent of the aphorism "To know and not to do, is, not to know", I've always strived to combine and apply knowledge from different fields in life. This tendency has helped me a lot, be it in winning the intra college robotic arm challenge or earning a trade secret for my NLP work at Visa.<br/>
    Recently, I'm trying to understand what happens in brain when we meditate by applying machine learning on EEG data. Feel free to reach out and discuss Meditation or Machine Learning or both !
