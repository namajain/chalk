Like everyone else, I have many dreams. I want to write a novel, travel the world, make games, become famous, make lots of money, delve into psychology, start a youtube channel, write a blog, learn trading, be fearless. But I feel I haven't made significant progress towards them. I have dabbled in everything but left after encountering small roadblocks.<br /><br />It isn't that I'm afraid to put in the effort or work hard. No, what I'm afraid of is the uncertainty, unknown situations. I need someone to show me the way, I don't like to go out of my comfort zone and figure stuff out, no that's annoying, and painful, instead what I do?<br /><br />I play games, watch animes, read novels, indulge myself without using my brain. I banish these dreams in a corner of my mind, saying I will address them soon, but that soon becomes be too long. A similar situation arises when studying for the exams, but there is a pretty good thing about it, <b>deadlines</b>, they jolt me into taking action and because of that, I am able to maintain a decent enough grade.<br /><br />But the problem with life goals are - <b>there are no deadlines, no wake-up calls</b>. If you don't do anything now, chances are, you won't do anything ever. It's ironic because I recently wrote a <a href="http://legacynj.blogspot.in/2016/11/the-road-not-taken.html">post </a>about this same issue without realizing I myself am suffering from it.<br /><br />But the situation isn't all that bad now. The first step to improvement is awareness. I have started understanding my flaws. Slowly but steadily I'm improving. I become better with each passing day. Soon, the world will bow before my awesomeness :p<br />Jokes aside, I will work on self-control, and not giving up any task until I become proficient in it, no matter how repulsive it seems.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N87XRrgXuo0/WFFI1DTQI4I/AAAAAAAAU5c/6Njahz0YHsI9zSS-1Oa0TywpXmCcgdFgwCLcB/s1600/DSCF0087.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="530" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N87XRrgXuo0/WFFI1DTQI4I/AAAAAAAAU5c/6Njahz0YHsI9zSS-1Oa0TywpXmCcgdFgwCLcB/s640/DSCF0087.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br />
