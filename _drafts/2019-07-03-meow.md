# Summary
Woke up and to dhaniya's
read farewell card, made tea, went to that cafe, it was closed, bought buiscuits on the way back, then ginger, tomato and banana, soaped the tea with ginger, had buiscuits,talked with dhaniya about life and goals, made sandwitches, got stuff from her place and sent her away.  
went to office to have lunch then came back and had lunch. Then got toastmasters tshirt, talked with naresh, talked with ishan and he was really helpful about moneyview.
Met with shreyash, he will refer me to amazon,also maybe can find a home at his place
