There was a workshop today on soft skills development. Honestly, it was utterly useless.The topics covered were not relevant to the context at all. It seemed as if she just copied the slides from some corporate workshop, and I don't even want to start on the quality and design of the slides. <br />Anyway in midst of this, a guy started playing on his phone to alleviate the boredom when, unfortunately, the instructor noticed him. She started barking at him told that he can leave if the course is not to his liking. That poor guy shut up his phone, but, I stood up and left.<br />I was once again reminded of these two important nuggets of wisdom-<br /><ul><li>You only get a limited number of fucks to give over your lifetime, so you must spend them with care</li></ul><ul><li>Until you value yourself, you wonâ€™t value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything worthwhile with it.</li></ul>
