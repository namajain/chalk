What an year it was. I did many things I never thought of doing. I went to gym for 6 months,became more punctual/hardworking, made new friends be it on a bus ride, flight or taxi, lost a couple of friends, improved photography, saw people die, woke at 6 am most part of the year, bathed daily at the count of 3 under chilled water, did public speaking, suffered heartbreak, tried to propose a TA, went usa, went andaman, did scuba diving, cancelled flights, took pic of tejshree's home, wrote poem, made friends with a 15 yo badass poet, wrote poems myself, devoured self help books, brought a tab, broke it, got tipsy, tried my hands at pickup, talked to random strangers, dated a vampire, attended graphics lecture, tortured others with singing, got scouted by a roadside pamphlate distributor, went to his hostel, ate lunch and discussed meaning of life for 5 hours straight, never did an assignment and got perfect score, saw a code fun do through the end, caught chickenpox, bramhaputra beach night shoot, trding account, swiped off cognac<br /><br />Attachment is bad, be it with people, games or other things.<br />Integrity hard work and persistence are awesome<br />You'll never feel like it, there would always<br /><br />2016 was an awesome year, Did many things never thought I could do, Met many interesting people in the unlikeliest of places, got to learn many new things both about the world and myself, and at the end of it all, I can proudly say, 2016 was not "just another year".<br />I feel 2017 is gonna be even more awesome and hope the same for everyone, Happy new year
