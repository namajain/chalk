There are times when you are able to superimpose one situation onto another seemingly unrelated one, such that it perfectly captures its essence. Recently I realized a similar superimposition, one that involves Chicken farms and Business parks.<br /><br />The similarity is eerie. The chickens ( read - workers ) are enclosed in barns ( offices ) and are exploited for things like eggs ( products ) and meat ( time ) . They wander around in their barns thinking they are completely free and unchained. Yet, they are bound by the invisible chains in the form of chicken feed, both literally and idiomatically.<br /><br />With &nbsp;advances in time and technology, driven by greed and the need for cutting costs, even this degree of freedom is being restricted. Modern <b>"Efficient" </b>barns stack grids of chickens in cages &nbsp;giving them only the bare minimum space just as the worker are thrust into their 6 by 6 cubicles.<br /><br />Every time I see those Multi-storied office complexes, I get reminded of poultry &nbsp;farms with chickens and their cages stacked on top of each other, toiling day and night to produce eggs, all just to get their feed<br /><br />
